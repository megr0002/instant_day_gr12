      <Text teksttype="fed">By participating in the contest, you accept the following terms and conditions:</Text>

      <Text teksttype="fed">Participation</Text>
      <Text teksttype="brødtekst">
        The competition is open to all photographers, both amateurs and professionals, who are over 18 years old.
      </Text>

      <Text teksttype="fed">Instant Photo</Text>
      <Text teksttype="brødtekst">
        Every submission has to be an analogue instant photo - not a digital montage made in a photo editing suite. The instant can be made in various ways, with analogue instant cameras, digital instant cameras like ie. the Fujifilm EVO or scan-and-print tools like ie. the Polaroid Lab. The instant photo can be manipulated with analogue processes - the organizers encourage instant photography experiments.
      </Text>
      <Text teksttype="brødtekst">
        The submission can depict the instant photo in many ways: As a flat scan without or without the instant photo frame, as a photo showing the instants in a frame, on the wall etc. The instant doesn’t need to be just one photo: It can be a panorama or collage of multiple instants that make up one submission.
      </Text>

      <Text teksttype="fed">Consent</Text>
      <Text teksttype="brødtekst">
        It is prohibited to upload photographs of people who have not given consent to the publication of the image. Images of people in private or embarrassing situations, regardless of whether they are photographed in a public place, are not allowed.
